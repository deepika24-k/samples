üìù Q1. Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for Hospital Management System (HMS)
Think of HMS like a hospital app. It helps to store patient details, book appointments, manage doctors and staff, and generate reports.
‚úÖ a. Functional Requirements (What the system should DO)
Add, update, and delete patient details.
Book, cancel, and reschedule appointments.
Maintain records of doctors and nurses.
Store patient medical history and reports.
Generate bills and manage payments.
Secure login for patients, doctors, and admin.
‚úÖ b. Non-Functional Requirements (How the system should WORK)
Security ‚Äì Patient data should be private (passwords, encryption).
Performance ‚Äì Should handle many users at the same time.
Scalability ‚Äì Should work even if the hospital grows bigger.
Usability ‚Äì Easy to use interface for doctors, patients, and staff.
Reliability ‚Äì System should not crash often.
‚úÖ c. Identification of Actors (Who uses the system)
Patient ‚Äì books appointments, views reports, pays bills.
Doctor ‚Äì checks patients, writes prescriptions.
Nurse/Staff ‚Äì updates patient care details, helps scheduling.
Admin ‚Äì manages users, doctors, and overall system.
Pharmacist ‚Äì gives medicines based on prescriptions.
Lab Staff ‚Äì uploads test results.
üñ•Ô∏è Q2. Maven Java Application Development
Now let‚Äôs make a Java project with Maven. Maven is just a tool that helps us build, run, and manage Java projects.
‚úÖ Step 1: Download the GitHub project
Open terminal / command prompt and type:
git clone https://github.com/Komblumbhargavi75/HospitalMano
cd HospitalMano
Now you will see files like:
pom.xml
src/main/java
src/test/java
‚úÖ Step 2: Clean and Package
Run:
mvn clean package
‚ö†Ô∏è If you type mvn CLEAN package ‚Üí error occurs because commands are lowercase only.
‚úÖ Step 3: Add servlet-api dependency
In the pom.xml file, inside <dependencies> add this:
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.5</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
‚úÖ Step 4: Fix JDK 21 Issue
Some libraries are old and don‚Äôt work with JDK 21.
Add this inside pom.xml:
<properties>
  <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
  <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
üëâ This tells Maven to use Java 8 compatibility.
‚úÖ Step 5: Fix Wrong JUnit Dependency
Wrong:
<dependency>
  <groupld>SE</groupld>   <!-- spelling mistake -->
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.6.0</version>
</dependency>
Correct:
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.6</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
‚úÖ Step 6: Change WAR File Name
By default, Maven generates:
HospitalMano-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war
If you want the file name to be HospitalManagementSystem.war, add this in pom.xml:
<build>
  <finalName>HospitalManagementSystem</finalName>
</build>
üéØ Final pom.xml (Complete and Correct)
Here is the full corrected file you can use directly:
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 
         http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.hospital</groupId>
    <artifactId>HospitalManagementSystem</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>war</packaging>

    <properties>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- Servlet API -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
            <version>2.5</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>

        <!-- JUnit for Testing -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>

Q4. Docker containerization for Maven Application-20M (10-2-20)
Task: Containerize your Maven project using Docker.
a. Refer the given link/documentation to write a Dockerfile for the Maven project
https://github.com/Kumbhambhargavi75/1HospitalMgmtSystem
Ensure it copies the WAR/JAR and runs on Tomcat (or relevant¬†base¬†image)    give every question in a very detailed way. i dont know anything


7) Add the central dependency of Java Servlet API 4.0.0 (the requested 4.0.0-601 looks non-standard) ‚Äî update POM and run (2M)

Short answer: use the official servlet API dependency and mark it provided (Servlet container like Tomcat provides it at runtime). I couldn‚Äôt find an artifact named 4.0.0-601 on Maven Central ‚Äî the standard artifact is javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:4.0.0 or the newer jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:4.x. Use the javax.servlet 4.0.0 if your code targets Servlet 4.0. 
Maven Central
Dependency to add inside <dependencies>:
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>4.0.0</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>

How to check / run:
Put that dependency inside your pom.xml <dependencies>...</dependencies>.
Run:
mvn clean package
You should get target/YourArtifactId-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war (or whatever <finalName> you configured).
8) A developer removes the <dependencies> section completely. Will Maven still build? Issues during testing? (2M)
Will Maven build?
Maybe. Maven will still run, but compilation will fail if your code refers to any external classes (like javax.servlet.*, junit, Spring, etc.). If your project only uses the JDK classes and has no external libs, mvn package may succeed.
Issues you‚Äôll see:
Compile errors (missing types).
Unit tests fail because testing frameworks (JUnit) are no longer on classpath.
Plugins or integration steps expecting dependencies may fail.
Fix: restore the <dependencies> block and re-add the required dependencies (copy from a working backup or add the servlet & junit dependencies shown above).
9) Identify the error:
Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.1:compile 
... Compilation failure ... No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?
Cause & fix (2M)
Cause: Maven needs the Java compiler (javac). That error shows your environment uses a JRE (Java Runtime) instead of a JDK (Java Development Kit) or JAVA_HOME points to a JRE. Maven cannot compile without the JDK. (This is a very common error.) 
Stack Overflow
Roufid
Fix (quick):
Install a JDK (e.g., OpenJDK 11 or 17).
Ensure javac exists:
javac -version
java -version

javac must print a version (not an error).
Set JAVA_HOME to JDK location and add $JAVA_HOME/bin to PATH.
Linux / macOS (example for openjdk11):
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

Windows (PowerShell example):
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.x"
$env:PATH = $env:JAVA_HOME + "\bin;" + $env:PATH
Re-run:
mvn -v   # check Maven sees correct Java
mvn clean package
In IDEs (Eclipse/IntelliJ) also check the Java runtime used by the IDE and Maven integration.
10) If <finalName> is set to localhost:8080/FoodSystem ‚Äî will it work? How to fix? (2M)
No ‚Äî that won't work. <finalName> must be a filename (no URL, no slashes). Maven will try to create an artifact with that literal name and it will be invalid or cause unexpected results.
What it should be: just the WAR file base name, e.g.
<build>
  <finalName>FoodSystem</finalName>
</build>

This produces FoodSystem.war. To make the app accessible at http://localhost:8080/FoodSystem, deploy FoodSystem.war to Tomcat webapps.
If you want the app at root / rename the WAR to ROOT.war or use Tomcat context configuration (Tomcat decides URL path from WAR name or context config). See Tomcat docs about context path and ROOT.war. 
Apache Tomcat
Baeldung on Kotlin
11) Project meant to deploy on Tomcat but <packaging>jar</packaging> ‚Äî how to solve? (2M)
Change packaging to war in pom.xml:
<packaging>war</packaging>
Why: Tomcat expects a WAR (Web Application Archive). jar builds a normal Java library/application, not a web archive.
Important notes after switching:
Keep the servlet API dependency with <scope>provided</scope> so Tomcat supplies it at runtime.
Ensure your webapp folder layout exists: src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml (or use Servlet annotations).

12) <url>http://maven.java.org12/url> ‚Äî will Maven accept it? Purpose of the <url> element? (3M)
Will it accept it? No ‚Äî your XML is malformed (closing tag missing < and > in your example) and the URL looks invalid (maven.java.org12 is not a correct hostname). Maven requires well-formed XML.
Correct syntax & purpose:
<url>http://example.com/your-project-homepage</url>
The <url> element is optional and simply points to the project‚Äôs homepage (used in generated reports and documentation). It is for humans and tooling to know where the project lives. 
Apache Maven
13) Check the complete pom.xml and push into your GitHub account (3M)
Steps (assume repo already cloned and you edited pom.xml):
# check status
git status
# stage changes (pom.xml and anything else you changed)
git add pom.xml
# commit
git commit -m "Fix pom: add servlet-api, set packaging=war, set finalName"
# if you cloned from original repo and want to push to YOUR GitHub:
# 1) create a new empty repo in your GitHub account (via GitHub website), call it hospital-mgmt
# 2) then set remote and push:
git remote add myorigin https://github.com/<your-github-username>/hospital-mgmt.git
git push -u myorigin main   # or master, depending on your branch name
If the repo already has origin and you want to push to that remote, use git push origin main (or whichever branch you are on).
Q3 ‚Äî Git & GitHub Integration with Maven Project (30M)

I‚Äôll answer each numbered Git question with the precise command(s) and a short explanation.
You changed one file but haven't staged it yet and want to discard local changes (2M)
# modern command
git restore path/to/file
# older syntax works too
git checkout -- path/to/file
This resets that file to the last committed state.
You made a commit but typed the wrong commit message (haven't pushed yet). Fix it (2M)
git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"
This replaces the last commit message (and last commit). Don't --amend after pushing to a shared remote unless you coordinate with teammates.
View commit history of current branch in readable format (2M)
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
This gives a compact, visual history.
You're on main. Create branch Feature/patient and switch to it (2M)
git checkout -b Feature/patient
# or
git switch -c Feature/patient
You made commits locally and want to upload them to remote (2M)
git push origin Feature/patient
If it‚Äôs the first time pushing that branch and you want to set upstream:
git push -u origin Feature/patient
See all branches both locally and on the remote (2M)
git branch -a
git branch shows local; -a adds remote branches as remotes/origin/....
Create branch Suggestions and merge it into Feature/patient (3M)
# create and switch to Suggestions
git checkout -b Suggestions
# make changes, commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Add suggestions"
# switch to target branch
git checkout Feature/patient
# merge
git merge Suggestions
# push the merged result
git push origin Feature/patient
How do you pull the latest changes from the remote and merge into your local branch? (2M)
# simple way (fetch+merge)
git pull origin Feature/patient
# safer two-step (recommended)
git fetch origin
git merge origin/Feature/patient
Many prefer git pull --rebase to avoid unnecessary merge commits.
Pushing for the first time and want to set the remote branch (set upstream) (2M)
git push -u origin Feature/patient
After that you can simply git push and git pull.
You cloned a repo but later need to push changes to a different remote repo ‚Äî how to configure (3M)
Add a new remote and push there:
git remote add new-origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<new-repo>.git
git push -u new-origin main
Or change the existing origin URL:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<new-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
After git pull, local branch is behind remote ‚Äî bring local up to date without losing local changes (3M)
Two clean ways:
A) Rebase your local commits onto updated remote (recommended):
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/your-branch
B) Stash your local work, pull, then reapply:
git stash push -m "WIP"
git pull origin your-branch
git stash pop
Use rebase for a linear history; stash is fine for uncommitted work.
Delete a branch from the remote (2M)
git push origin --delete Feature/patient
# or older style
git push origin :Feature/patient
Apply a patch file provided by teammate and include it in your commit history (3M)
If your teammate gave a patch created by git format-patch or git diff > file.patch:
If patch is a git mbox/format-patch (series):
git am < 0001-some-change.patch
git am applies commits from mailbox patch and preserves author/commit message.
If patch is a plain unified diff (.patch):
git apply fix.patch       # apply changes to working tree
git add .
git commit -m "Apply patch from teammate: fix.patch"
If you want to preserve author/commit: use git am format or ask for format-patch.

Q4 ‚Äî Docker containerization for Maven Application (20M)

Goal: Build the Maven WAR and run it on Tomcat inside Docker. I‚Äôll give one simple, clear Dockerfile (multi-stage) that builds with Maven and then runs with Tomcat.
Approach: Multi-stage build ‚Äî first stage uses a Maven image to compile & package your project; second stage uses an official Tomcat image and copies the WAR into webapps/. Tomcat will deploy it. (This is the usual, recommended approach.) 
Baeldung on Kotlin
cprime.com
A. Example Dockerfile (multi-stage)
Put this Dockerfile at your project root (where pom.xml is):
# Stage 1: Build with Maven
FROM maven:3.8.8-jdk-11 AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# copy only maven files first to cache dependencies
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
# build the WAR (skip tests to speed up; remove -DskipTests to run tests)
RUN mvn -B clean package -DskipTests
# Stage 2: Run with Tomcat
FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk11-openjdk
# Remove default webapps if you want a clean container (optional)
RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
# copy the WAR generated by maven into tomcat as ROOT.war (or FoodSystem.war)
# Adjust path: target/<your-artifact>-<version>.war
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/target/HospitalManagementSystem.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
Notes:

I copy the WAR to ROOT.war to make the app available at http://localhost:8080/. If you want http://localhost:8080/FoodSystem, copy it as FoodSystem.war instead and access /FoodSystem/.
If your artifact name differs, replace HospitalManagementSystem.war with the real filename in target/.
You can remove -DskipTests to run tests in the image (slower).
Build and run commands:
# build image
docker build -t hospital-app:1.0 .
# run container (map container 8080 to host 8080)
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --name hospital-app hospital-app:1.0

Then open http://localhost:8080/ in the browser (or /FoodSystem/ if you named war accordingly).
If you already have a WAR locally: you can skip the Maven stage and use a simpler Dockerfile:
FROM tomcat:9.0-jdk11-openjdk
COPY target/HospitalManagementSystem.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]
How Tomcat determines context path: Tomcat decides the web app URL from the WAR filename or META-INF/context.xml. To deploy to root (/) you can name the WAR ROOT.war, or configure Tomcat context files. See Tomcat docs. 
Apache Tomcat
B. Extra tips and troubleshooting
If you see 404 after deploying: ls /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ inside container to confirm WAR is present; check Tomcat logs (docker logs <container>).
Permissions: if file copy fails, ensure Dockerfile paths are correct and file actually exists in target/.
Smaller images: you can use tomcat:9-jdk11-temurin or other variants ‚Äî check Docker Hub for available tags.
Build locally for debugging: run mvn clean package on your machine first, then test WAR locally on Tomcat before containerizing.
Quick checklist (copy-paste) ‚Äî to finish everything
Edit pom.xml: set <packaging>war</packaging>, add servlet dependency (provided), set <finalName>HospitalManagementSystem</finalName> (or FoodSystem).
Build locally:
mvn clean package
# check target/*.war exists
ls target
Docker build & run:
docker build -t hospital-app:1.0 .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 hospital-app:1.0

Push your code to GitHub:
git add pom.xml Dockerfile
git commit -m "Add servlet dependency, change packaging to war, add Dockerfile"
git push -u origin main

 2. After building the image, you want to list all available Docker images on your machine
Which command will you run
 3. You need to run the container and map container port 8080 to host port 9090.
Write the full Docker run command.
4. pull the officialredis image from Docker Hub, run it in a container and list of containers that are running right now and verify whether it is accessible on http://localhost:8080
5. After festing locally, you want to tag and push the image to Docker Hub under your account yourusername/ms
6. While running the container, you forgot to expose port mapping. Now you cannot access the app from your browser. What steps/commands will you take to stop the container and rerun it correctly?
7. The container crashes immediately after startup.
Which command will you use to inspect logs and debug the issue?
8. Push your custom Docker image (with the deployed application) to your Docker Hub account and make it available publicly
9. You want to connect into the running container interactively to check files Which CLI command will you use to open a shell inside the container?
10, you want to list the removed containers Which Docker CLI commands will you use?
05. DOCKER COMPOSE-10M
Write the compose file for CampusMgmtSystem application and MongoDB and service with docker-compose -SM
2. Container 1-Use the Docker image of your application you pushed to Docker Hub and run it on
7079-3M
3. Container 2 Runs a MongoDB container as the database and¬†work¬†on¬†that-2M         give every question in a very detailed way. i dont know anything



1) Build the Docker image called hospital-mgint
Assuming your Dockerfile is in the current directory (project root):
# build and tag as hospital-mgint:latest
docker build -t hospital-mgint:latest .
What this does:
docker build reads Dockerfile and builds an image.
-t hospital-mgint:latest gives the image the name (repository) hospital-mgint and tag latest.
. means build context is current directory.
Optional: To include your Docker Hub username (recommended when pushing):
docker build -t yourusername/hospital-mgint:1.0 .
2) List all Docker images on your machine
docker images
# or the newer syntax:
docker image ls
What you‚Äôll see: columns REPOSITORY, TAG, IMAGE ID, SIZE ‚Äî look for hospital-mgint (or yourusername/hospital-mgint).
3) Run the container mapping container port 8080 ‚Üí host port 9090
Full run command (detached, named container, port mapping):
docker run -d --name hospital-mgint-container -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgint:latest
Explanation:
-d runs container in background.
--name hospital-mgint-container gives the container a friendly name.
-p 9090:8080 maps host port 9090 to container port 8080. So open http://localhost:9090 in browser.
hospital-mgint:latest is the image to run.
If the container uses Tomcat and you want it accessible at host 9090, that mapping is correct.
If you prefer to remove container when stopped (no leftover containers):
docker run -d --rm --name hospital-mgint-container -p 9090:8080 hospital-mgint:latest
4) Pull official redis image, run it, list running containers, and verify HTTP access at http://localhost:8080
Commands:
# pull latest redis image
docker pull redis:latest
# run redis in background and map default redis port 6379
docker run -d --name redis-server -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
# list running containers
docker ps
Important note about HTTP
Redis does not speak HTTP. Redis exposes a TCP protocol on port 6379. So http://localhost:8080 will NOT work for Redis.
How to verify Redis is working:
From host (if you have redis-cli installed):
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping
# expected response: PONG
Or use a one-off container to run redis-cli:
docker run --rm -it --network host redis:latest redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379 ping
# or if not using host networking:
docker exec -it redis-server redis-cli ping
To check mapped ports:
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Ports}}"
So answer: you can confirm Redis with redis-cli/PING ‚Äî not with HTTP.
5) Tag and push the image to Docker Hub as yourusername/ms
Steps:
Log in to Docker Hub (interactive ‚Äî supply username/password or use token):
docker login
Tag image locally with Docker Hub repo name:
# If your local image is hospital-mgint:latest
docker tag hospital-mgint:latest yourusername/ms:latest
(Replace yourusername.)
Push to Docker Hub:
docker push yourusername/ms:latest
Notes:
You must have a Docker Hub account; if repo yourusername/ms does not exist, Docker Hub will create it (or you may need to create it on the website depending on settings).
After push succeeds, image will be available at https://hub.docker.com/r/yourusername/ms.

6) You forgot port mapping and cannot access app ‚Äî stop and rerun correctly
If container is running without port mapping:
List running containers to get name/ID:
docker ps
Stop and remove the container:
docker stop <container-name-or-id>
docker rm <container-name-or-id>
Example:
docker stop hospital-mgint-container
docker rm hospital-mgint-container
Re-run with proper port mapping:
docker run -d --name hospital-mgint-container -p 9090:8080 yourusername/ms:latest
(Or hospital-mgint:latest if using local image.)
Tip: You cannot change port mapping of an already-running container ‚Äî you must recreate it.

7) Container crashes immediately after startup ‚Äî inspect logs and debug
Check status (all containers including exited):
docker ps -a
Get logs for the container:
docker logs <container-name-or-id>
# follow logs live:
docker logs -f <container-name-or-id>
Other helpful debugging commands:
Inspect container metadata:
docker inspect <container-name-or-id>
Run container interactively to see startup output (replace your-image):
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh your-image
# or to see startup, run without -d:
docker run --name debug-run -p 9090:8080 your-image
If it's a Java/Tomcat app, docker logs will show stacktrace ‚Äî missing libs, wrong JAVA_HOME, port in use, or config errors are common causes.
8) Push your custom Docker image (deployed app) to Docker Hub and make it public
(Combines steps from #5 plus making it public.)
Commands:
# login
docker login
# tag local image to your hub repo
docker tag hospital-mgint:latest yourusername/ms:latest
# push to Docker Hub
docker push yourusername/ms:latest
Make repo public:
Sign in to Docker Hub web UI ‚Üí go to your repository yourusername/ms ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí set visibility to Public (if not already public).
(This step is done in the Docker Hub website UI; CLI does not toggle visibility.)
9) Open an interactive shell inside a running container
If container is running and has bash:
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
If bash is not available (alpine or minimal images), use sh:
docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/sh
Example:
docker exec -it hospital-mgint-container /bin/bash
This opens a shell inside container so you can ls, inspect config, check log files, etc.
If container is not running, you can start a temporary container with an interactive shell:
docker run --rm -it yourusername/ms:latest /bin/sh
10) List the removed containers
Important: removed containers are gone ‚Äî Docker does not keep a list of containers that have been deleted. But you can:
List all containers (running + stopped/exited):
docker ps -a
List only stopped/exited containers:
docker ps -a -f "status=exited"
# or
docker ps -f "status=exited"
If you want to remove (delete) all stopped containers:
docker container prune
If by ‚Äúremoved containers‚Äù you mean dangling images (untagged images), list them:
docker images -f "dangling=true"
If you need a historical record of container events (start/stop/delete), inspect Docker event log (streaming):
docker events --since '24h'
But once a container is removed, docker ps -a will not show it.
DOCKER COMPOSE (10M) ‚Äî docker-compose.yml for CampusMgmtSystem + MongoDB
You asked:
Compose file for CampusMgmtSystem app and MongoDB.
Container 1: Use your app image (from Docker Hub) and run it on host port 7079.
Container 2: MongoDB container as database.
Here‚Äôs a simple, complete docker-compose.yml that does exactly that.
version: "3.8"
services:
  campus-app:
    image: yourusername/ms:latest        # <-- replace with your Docker Hub image
    container_name: campus-app
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "7079:8080"                      # host:container (assuming app listens on 8080 in container)
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/campusdb
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/campusdb
      # add any other env vars your app expects, e.g. DB user/password
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    networks:
      - campus-net

  mongo:
    image: mongo:6.0                      # official MongoDB image
    container_name: campus-mongo
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ./mongo-data:/data/db             # persist DB on host
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: campusdb
    networks:
      - campus-net
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mongo", "--eval", "db.adminCommand('ping')"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

networks:
  campus-net:
    driver: bridge

How it works (simple)

campus-app uses your Docker Hub image yourusername/ms:latest. Replace that with the image you pushed.

It maps host port 7079 to container port 8080 (adjust container port if your image uses a different internal port).

mongo runs MongoDB, stores data in ./mongo-data on the host so DB persists across restarts.

depends_on ensures Docker starts mongo before campus-app. (It does not guarantee Mongo is ready ‚Äî we added a healthcheck to improve readiness.)
Commands to run
# start services in background
docker-compose up -d
# follow logs
docker-compose logs -f
# stop and remove containers (and network), but keep volumes
docker-compose down
# stop and remove containers, network and volumes
docker-compose down -v
Verify

Check containers:
docker-compose ps
# or
docker ps
Access app in browser:
http://localhost:7079
(or Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. if running on remote host.)

Check Mongo is up:
docker exec -it campus-mongo mongo --eval "db.stats()"
Final tips & checklist (so you don‚Äôt get lost)
Replace yourusername with your Docker Hub username wherever I wrote it.
Always docker login before docker push.
To check port mapping quickly:
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"

If app uses a different internal port (not 8080), change the :8080 to that port in all -p HOST:CONTAINER mappings and in docker-compose.
If using Windows and Docker Desktop, these commands still work in PowerShell/Git Bash.
If containers fail to start, docker logs <name> is your first friend.

) Abstract ‚Äî 4M

The Food Ordering System is a web application for the campus cafeteria that lets students and faculty browse the menu, place orders (dine-in or take-away), pay digitally, and receive live order status updates. Administrators can update menu items, prices and view order history. Kitchen staff see incoming orders and update their preparation status. The system must be simple to use, secure for payments, and fast enough to handle many simultaneous orders during peak hours.

b) Functional Requirements ‚Äî 2M (what the system must do)

Write these as simple short items:

User registration & login (students, faculty) ‚Äî create account, login, logout.

Browse menu ‚Äî view categories (breakfast, lunch, snacks), item details and images.

Place order ‚Äî choose Dine-in or Take-away, add items, select quantity, checkout.

Digital payments ‚Äî support card/UPI/college wallet; record payment status.

Order status ‚Äî show real-time updates: Pending ‚Üí Preparing ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Completed.

Admin panel ‚Äî add/edit/remove menu items, change prices, view/resolve orders.

Kitchen view ‚Äî list of active orders with ability to change status and mark ready.

(Each item is a single, testable function.)

c) Non-Functional Requirements ‚Äî 2M (how well it must work)

Performance: Page loads < 2s; system supports X concurrent users (define X for your college).

Availability: 99% uptime during cafeteria hours.

Security: HTTPS, secure storage of payment tokens (no raw card data), role-based access control.

Usability: Clean UI, mobile responsive, accessible (large fonts, clear buttons).

Maintainability: Clear code structure and documentation so future devs can update menu/features.

d) Identification of Users ‚Äî 2M

List user roles and short description:

Student / Faculty (Customer): Orders food, selects dine-in/takeaway, pays, checks status.

Cafeteria Admin: Manages menu, prices, view reports and orders.

Kitchen Staff: Sees incoming orders, updates order status (Preparing / Ready).

System Administrator / DevOps: Manages deployments, backups, DB, and system security.

Payment Gateway (external): Third-party service that processes payments.

QII ‚Äî Maven Web Application Development (30M)

You were given: https://github.com/Kumbhambhargavi75/FoodSystem ‚Äî I checked the repo listing and copied the top-level files here for you.

1) finalName typo:

The finalName in the build section is written as SfinalName>Food-System/finalName> ‚Äî What artifact will be generated in the target folder, and why might this cause deployment issues in Tomcat? ‚Äî 2M

What finalName does (simple):
<finalName> controls the filename / folder under target/ that Maven will produce for your build (for webapps it controls the WAR name / exploded folder). The exploded WAR directory defaults to target/<finalName>. 
Apache Maven

Two possible situations (what that broken text means):

If the tag is intended and correct: e.g.

<build>
  <finalName>Food-System</finalName>
</build>


Maven will create target/Food-System.war (or target/Food-System/ for exploded war). Tomcat will use the WAR filename to decide the web context (/Food-System), so your app URL would be http://host:8080/Food-System. If you expected a different context (like root / or /cafeteria) this mismatch causes deployment surprises. 
Apache Maven
Octopus Deploy

If the tag is actually malformed (like the snippet SfinalName>Food-System/finalName> that is missing < or </ or is mistyped): Maven may fail to read the POM (XML not well-formed) or will ignore a wrong tag and fall back to defaults (artifactId-version.war). If Maven falls back, the artifact will be target/<artifactId>-<version>.war and not the name you wanted ‚Äî again Tomcat context will be different. If the POM is malformed XML you will get a non-parseable POM error and the build stops. 
Stack Overflow
Apache Maven

Why this can cause Tomcat deployment issues:

Wrong WAR name ‚Üí wrong context path (Tomcat maps WAR filename to context). If you expected to access / or /FoodSystem but mvn produced a different name, Tomcat will expose a different URL. 
Octopus Deploy

If POM is malformed, Maven build fails and no WAR is produced at all (so nothing to deploy).

How to fix (very simple): open pom.xml, find <build> and ensure you have:

<build>
  <finalName>Food-System</finalName>
</build>


Then run:

mvn clean package
# check target/ for Food-System.war
ls -la target/

2) Download repository and list files ‚Äî 2M

How to download (one command):

git clone https://github.com/Kumbhambhargavi75/FoodSystem.git
cd FoodSystem
ls -la


(If you don‚Äôt have git, download ZIP from GitHub page.)

Files/folders I can see at repo root (top level):

.settings

src/main/webapp

target

.classpath

.project

Dockerfile

pom.xml
(These items come from the repo file list shown on GitHub.) 
GitHub

If you cd into the project and run tree you‚Äôll see full structure (install tree or use ls -R).
Commands to view pom.xml:

cat pom.xml     # print to terminal

3) Missing JUnit <version> ‚Äî what Maven does & how to ensure correct version ‚Äî 3M

What happens if version is missing:

Maven requires a version for a dependency unless the version is provided by a parent POM or a <dependencyManagement> (BOM or parent). If the version is missing and not managed, Maven will complain (build fails) ‚Äî common error: dependencies.dependency.version is missing or similar. In short: Maven can‚Äôt pick a version by magic (unless inherited/managed). 
Stack Overflow
Apache Maven

How to make sure a proper version is used (simple steps):

Quick fix (explicit): add a version in your dependency:

<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <version>4.13.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


(That ensures Maven downloads JUnit 4.13.2.)

Better in multi-module projects: put versions centrally in a parent POM‚Äôs <dependencyManagement> or import a BOM (e.g. Spring Boot parent) so child modules can omit <version> safely.

To check what version is actually used: run:

mvn help:effective-pom    # shows the POM after inheritance and dependencyManagement applied
mvn dependency:tree       # shows resolved dependency versions and transitive dependencies


help:effective-pom is very useful to see which version will be used after inheritance.

4) What error will Maven throw during mvn install for XML/tag mistakes and how to debug ‚Äî 2M

If you misspell <artifactId> as <artificatld> (typo):

Two possibilities:

If you wrote an unknown tag but the XML is still well-formed, Maven will usually see the <dependency> is missing a required child (artifactId) and will fail the build with a POM validation error during validate (it will say a dependency element is missing required parts or show a Missing artifact style error when it can‚Äôt resolve the dependency).

If the XML is not well-formed (badly closed tags), Maven will throw Non-parseable POM / Failed to parse POM errors and stop immediately. Example errors are ‚ÄúNon-parseable POM‚Äù or ‚ÄúFailed to parse POMs‚Äù ‚Äî these mean your pom.xml is malformed XML. 
Stack Overflow
Examples Java Code Geeks

How to debug (simple checklist):

Open pom.xml in an IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ) ‚Äî the XML editor will highlight typos immediately.

Run quick XML check:

xmllint --noout pom.xml        # on Linux/Mac (installs via libxml)


Run Maven in debug to see full trace:

mvn -X clean install


Use mvn help:effective-pom to see the final merged POM (helps find missing / overridden pieces). 
Apache Maven
Stack Overflow

Fix: change <artificatld> ‚Üí <artifactId> and ensure the dependency block has <groupId>, <artifactId>, and (if needed) <version>.

5) You wrote <packing> instead of <packaging> ‚Äî what happens? ‚Äî 2M

What Maven assumes by default:
If <packaging> is missing, Maven defaults to jar packaging. So if you accidentally write <packing> (typo), Maven does not see the packaging and will treat the project as jar. 
Apache Maven

Impact for a web project:

Web projects must use <packaging>war</packaging>. With default jar, Maven will create a JAR (not a WAR). That means the WAR plugin won‚Äôt run and you‚Äôll not get a .war file to deploy to Tomcat -> deployment fails or Tomcat can‚Äôt accept the artifact. Fix: correct the tag:

<packaging>war</packaging>

6) Malformed MySQL dependency snippet ‚Äî what happens & correct snippet ‚Äî 3M

You showed:

<dependency>
  <groupId>mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector/artifactId>
  <version>8.0.30</version>
</dependency>


Problems here:

The <artifactId> closing tag is malformed (mysql-connector/artifactId>). This is invalid XML ‚Üí Maven will likely report a non-parseable POM or XML parsing error and stop. 
Stack Overflow

Also the usual correct artifactId for Connector/J is mysql-connector-java (older coords) or mysql-connector-j (newer coords depending on version). Using a wrong artifactId would lead Maven to try to resolve a non-existent artifact and then show a Missing artifact error. To be safe, use the official coordinates.

Correct dependency (one that works for 8.0.30):

<dependency>
  <groupId>mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.30</version>
</dependency>


or for newer coordinates (some versions):

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.33</version>
</dependency>


(Maven Central / repo info shows how to use these coordinates.) 
Maven Central
Maven Repository

To test / fix:

# after fixing pom.xml
mvn clean package     # or mvn dependency:resolve
mvn dependency:tree   # to see that mysql-connector is resolved

Quick checklist (copy & paste) ‚Äî for your assignment submission

Fix pom.xml typos: <finalName>, <packaging>, <artifactId>, <version> ‚Äî watch angle brackets carefully.

For JUnit add a version (4.13.2) or rely on parent <dependencyManagement>.

For MySQL use mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.30 or com.mysql:mysql-connector-j:8.0.xx. 
Maven Central

Commands to build and inspect:

git clone https://github.com/Kumbhambhargavi75/FoodSystem.git

Q6 ‚Äî "Maven throws 'dependency not found'. What mistake was made, and what are the correct Maven coordinates for MySQL Connector?" (3M)

What likely went wrong (simple):

The POM had a wrong artifactId or a malformed XML tag (for example you showed mysql-connector/artifactId> and a broken closing tag). That makes Maven either fail to parse the POM or it tries to find an artifact with the wrong name and cannot find it ‚Üí dependency not found.

Also MySQL‚Äôs coordinates changed in recent years, so using old coordinates can lead to ‚Äúnot found‚Äù errors.

Correct coordinates (recommended now):
Use the official Connector/J coordinates published by MySQL:

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>8.0.30</version>  <!-- or a newer 8.0.x you prefer -->
  <!-- runtime is usually fine for JDBC drivers -->
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>


(Older projects sometimes used mysql:mysql-connector-java, but the current official coordinates are com.mysql:mysql-connector-j.) 
MySQL Developer Zone
Stack Overflow

How to fix step-by-step (child style):

Open pom.xml.

Find the broken dependency for MySQL. Fix any broken tags so it looks exactly like the XML above (angles, closing tags matter!).

Save and run:

mvn clean package
mvn dependency:tree    # to check the dependency was downloaded/resolved


If Maven still says "not found", copy the exact groupId/artifactId/version into a browser search of Maven Central to confirm that version exists.

Q7 ‚Äî Tomcat plugin snippet fails when running mvn tomcat7:run. What is missing and why? (3M)

You showed:

<plugin>
  <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.2</version>
</plugin>


What‚Äôs missing: the <groupId>. Maven needs the groupId for plugins that are not in the default plugin groups. The Tomcat 7 plugin‚Äôs groupId is org.apache.tomcat.maven. Without it Maven cannot find the plugin by artifactId alone (unless you configured pluginGroups in settings.xml).

Correct plugin block:

<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>tomcat7-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.2</version>
</plugin>


Why: Maven resolves plugin prefixes only in standard plugin groups or those added to <pluginGroups> in your settings. Tomcat‚Äôs plugin is published under org.apache.tomcat.maven, so you must specify that groupId or Maven won‚Äôt recognize tomcat7:run. 
Apache Tomcat
Apache Software Foundation

Q8 ‚Äî In <url> tag you wrote <url>localhost:8080/FoodSystem</url>. Will Maven accept this? What is <url> for? (2M)

Short: Maven will accept a string, but that tag is for the project's homepage or project URL (where users find docs or project site), not for telling Tomcat where to deploy. Also include the scheme (like http://) if you use a real URL.

Example correct use:

<url>http://example.com/my-food-system</url>


Purpose: It documents where the project lives (homepage, project site) for humans and some tools ‚Äî not a deployment target. Deployment to Tomcat is done by copying the WAR or using the Tomcat plugin (configuration in plugin <configuration>), not by <url> in the POM. 
Apache Maven
Stack Overflow

Q9 ‚Äî A developer removes the <dependencies> section completely. Will Maven still build? What problems in testing? (2M)

Simple answer: Maven might still run basic phases, but your app will very likely fail to compile or tests will fail, because classes from external libraries (JDBC driver, servlet API used in compile, JUnit, etc.) aren‚Äôt available on the classpath.

What will happen:

If your code imports classes from libraries that were in <dependencies>, mvn compile will show ‚Äúcannot find symbol‚Äù / missing class errors.

Tests will fail because JUnit or other test libs are missing.

If you somehow compiled earlier and removed dependencies, your package may produce a broken artifact or a JAR/WAR missing required libraries.

Fix: Restore necessary <dependency> blocks (groupId, artifactId, version). Use mvn dependency:tree to see what you need.

Q10 ‚Äî If deployed in Tomcat the context path is http://localhost:8080/FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT, what will be the output and why? (3M)

Short explanation: Tomcat maps the context path to the WAR file (or exploded directory) name. If your WAR file is named FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war, Tomcat will, by default, host it at http://localhost:8080/FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT (the context path is the file name without .war). That‚Äôs why you see the version suffix in the URL. If you want a different URL (like /FoodSystem or /), rename the WAR or use a Tomcat context configuration file. 
Apache Tomcat
Octopus Deploy

Q11 ‚Äî You have finalName>Food-system-xyz/finalName> in <build>. What will the generated WAR be and how will it affect Tomcat URL? (2M)

Two cases:

If you meant <finalName>Food-system-xyz</finalName> (correct XML): Maven will produce target/Food-system-xyz.war (or exploded folder) and Tomcat will map it to http://host:port/Food-system-xyz ‚Äî that becomes the context path.

If the tag is malformed (like missing angle brackets), Maven will fail to parse the POM (XML error) or ignore it ‚Äî build will fail or fallback to default artifact name <artifactId>-<version>.war. So always ensure the tag is exactly <finalName>...</finalName>.

Q12 ‚Äî <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>: what WAR name will Maven generate, and how does SNAPSHOT affect other projects? (2M)

WAR name produced: if you have default finalName (artifactId), Maven produces artifactId-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war ‚Äî the version becomes part of the filename.

SNAPSHOT impact (important):

-SNAPSHOT means this is a mutable, in-development version. When a project depends on 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT, Maven may fetch a newer snapshot when building (it‚Äôs not a stable release). That causes non-repeatable builds and other projects that depend on this snapshot may get different binaries over time. Use SNAPSHOT only during active development, not for released dependencies.

Q13 ‚Äî Add central dependency of Java Servlet API 3.1 to project; check complete pom.xml and run it. (2M)

Correct dependency (Servlet API 3.1.0) ‚Äî use provided scope for web apps (the servlet container ‚Äî Tomcat ‚Äî already provides this at runtime):

<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>


This is the official artifact on Maven Central. Use provided so Maven compiles your code against the servlet API but does not package it into the WAR (Tomcat provides it).

‚Äî Git & GitHub Integration with Maven Project (30M) ‚Äî very detailed, step-by-step like you‚Äôre a child

Assume you are inside your project folder (where pom.xml is).

1. Initialize a Git repository inside the project

Command:

git init


What this does (simple): creates a .git folder and starts tracking version history in this folder.

2. Set your Git username and email globally (so commits show your identity)

Commands:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"


Why: Git uses these values to label every commit you make.

3. After initializing, connect to a GitHub repository (remote)

Option A ‚Äî add a remote to an already created GitHub repo:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/YourRepo.git


Option B ‚Äî clone from Github (they get a copy to their machine):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/YourRepo.git


(If you use SSH later, use the git@github.com:... form.)

4. Commit staged changes with message "Added Order Service for Food Ordering System"

Steps:

git add .                          # stage all changed files
git status                         # see staged files
git commit -m "Added Order Service for Food Ordering System"


What it does: git add stages files; git commit records the snapshot with your message.

5. Create and switch to a new branch feature/payment

Command (new Git way):

git switch -c feature/payment


Or older alternative:

git checkout -b feature/payment


Simple: this creates the branch and moves you onto it so you can work separately.

6. You staged the wrong file temp.txt. Remove it from staging but keep the file locally

Command:

git reset temp.txt


What happens: temp.txt remains in the folder but it‚Äôs no longer staged for commit.

7. Verify the list of remote repositories connected to your project

Command:

git remote -v


It shows: the origin (and others) fetch/push URLs.

8. You want to temporarily save uncommitted changes to test another branch (stash), then restore later

Save/stash changes:

git stash save "WIP: testing payment flow"
# or simply
git stash


Switch branches and test.
Restore the latest stash:

git stash pop   # applies stash and removes it from list
# or
git stash apply # applies stash but keeps it in stash list

9. Your teammate completed feature/Reviews and you want to merge it into main. Steps:

Switch to main:

git switch main


Make sure main is up to date:

git pull origin main


Merge the feature branch:

git merge feature/Reviews


If there are conflicts, Git will tell you; open the conflicted files, fix them, then:

git add <fixed-files>
git commit   # completes the merge commit if necessary


Push the merged main to remote:

git push origin main

10. A teammate wants to copy the project from GitHub to their machine (clone)

Command they should run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/YourRepo.git


(Or, using SSH: git clone git@github.com:your-username/YourRepo.git)

11. You completed feature/real-time-status and want to push it to GitHub

Commands:

git switch feature/real-time-status
git add .
git commit -m "Implement real-time order status"
git push -u origin feature/real-time-status


-u sets the upstream so in future you can just do git push.

12. Instead of HTTPS you want to use SSH for GitHub ‚Äî two main steps (short & clear)

Step A ‚Äî create an SSH key locally:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
# (Press Enter to accept defaults; give a passphrase if you want)


If your system doesn‚Äôt support ed25519, use:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com"


Step B ‚Äî add the public key to your GitHub account:

Copy the public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key ‚Üí paste and save.

Now change remote to SSH or clone via SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/YourRepo.git
# or clone using:
git clone git@github.com:your-username/YourRepo.git


That‚Äôs it ‚Äî you‚Äôll now authenticate via your SSH key instead of typing username/password.

QIII: Git ‚Äì Applying Patch

üëâ Scenario: Your teammate sends you a .patch file (say fix-style.patch) with a CSS fix. You want to apply it, test it locally, and make it part of your Git history.

1. Apply the patch file
git apply fix-style.patch


git apply takes the changes inside the patch file and applies them to your working directory.

After this, your code will be updated, but not yet committed.

2. Test it locally

Run your application (for example in Eclipse, or with mvn clean install and deploy). Check if the CSS fix works.

3. Stage the changes
git add .


(This adds the patched files to staging.)

4. Commit it
git commit -m "Applied CSS fix from teammate patch"


Now the patch changes are part of your Git history.

üëâ If you want to apply and commit patch in one go:

git am fix-style.patch


git am = apply patch + create a commit automatically with the author‚Äôs details.

QIV: Docker Containerization for Maven Application

We want to run the Food Ordering System inside a Docker container.

a. Write a Dockerfile

Example Dockerfile for a Maven WebApp (WAR file):

# Step 1: Use Maven to build the project
FROM maven:3.8.6-jdk-11 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Step 2: Use Tomcat as runtime
FROM tomcat:9.0
COPY --from=build /app/target/FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/FoodSystem.war

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

docker run -it --name mypython python:latest
docker ps


7. Verify web app on port 8080, resolve conflict

If another service already uses port 8080 ‚Üí use a different port:

docker run -d -p 9090:5000 my-web-app


8. If app fails on 8080 ‚Üí update Dockerfile, rebuild & run on 9090

docker build -t my-web-app .
docker run -d -p 9090:8080 my-web-app


9. Stop & restart a container

docker stop myweb
docker start myweb


10. Check container status

docker ps -a

QV: Docker-Compose

We want Food Ordering System app + PostgreSQL DB running together.

1. docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  foodsystem:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/foodsystem:latest
    ports:
      - "7078:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: foodadmin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: foodpass
      POSTGRES_DB: fooddb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

2. Pull and run app on port 7078

When you run:

docker-compose up -d


It will pull FoodSystem image from Docker Hub

Expose it at http://localhost:7078/FoodSystem

3. Run PostgreSQL and insert data

Database is automatically started inside the container.

Connect:

docker exec -it <db-container-id> psql -U foodadmin -d fooddb


Then insert sample data:

INSERT INTO orders (id, item, price) VALUES (1, 'Pizza', 200);


‚úÖ Done! You now have:

Patch applied correctly in Git.

Dockerized Maven WebApp.

Docker-Compose running App + PostgreSQL.

Do you want me to also write the exact commands to push your built Docker image to Docker Hub (so that your compose file can use it)?

You said:
give every question in a very detailed way from scartch like iam a child
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 21s

Great ‚Äî I‚Äôll explain every step slowly and simply, as if you‚Äôre seeing this for the first time. I‚Äôll show the exact commands, explain what each one does, how to test, and what to do if something goes wrong.

I‚Äôll cover (A) applying a Git patch and making it part of history, (B) Docker basics and the 10 Docker questions, and (C) Docker Compose for the Food Ordering System (including inserting initial data).

A. Git ‚Äî apply a patch, test, and make it part of your history (3 marks ‚Äî explained like a child)

Scenario: Your teammate emailed fix-style.patch which changes some CSS. You must apply it, test it locally, and make it a commit in your repo.

1) Two ways to apply a patch ‚Äî same idea, different effects

git apply fix-style.patch

What it does: applies the changes inside the patch file to your working folder (files on disk change), but no commit is created and the patch author metadata is not preserved.

Use when: you just want the changes in your working copy so you can test and then make your own commit.

git am fix-style.patch

What it does: applies the patch and creates a commit using the author/date/message from the patch (if patch was created with git format-patch). This makes the patch part of history automatically.

Use when: the patch is from a colleague and you want to preserve their author info and message.

2) Step-by-step ‚Äî apply, test, commit, push (child-style)

Assume you‚Äôre already inside the project folder (where .git and pom.xml live).

A. Save the patch file into the project folder

(If patch is in email, download it to the project folder or copy it there.)

B. Apply the patch to working directory (no commit yet)
git apply fix-style.patch


If this runs with no output and exit code 0, the files were updated.

If you see errors like error: patch failed: then the patch did not apply cleanly (maybe files changed since patch created).

If patch fails to apply:

Try git apply --reject fix-style.patch ‚Äî this will write .rej files for hunks that failed; open those .rej files and manually fix the files.

If the patch was made by git format-patch (mailbox), use git am fix-style.patch instead ‚Äî it can handle mailbox format.

C. Check what changed (very important)
git status        # shows modified files
git diff          # shows the actual code changes


Look at the changed file(s) to ensure the CSS fix looks right.

D. Test locally (how to test CSS fix)

If the app runs in Tomcat: build & run locally and open the page.

mvn clean package
# Deploy target/FoodSystem.war to Tomcat (or use mvn tomcat7:run if configured)


Alternatively, if frontend files served statically: open the page in browser (http://localhost:8080/
...) and check the CSS change visually.

Use browser DevTools (F12) to inspect the changed CSS rule and confirm it's loaded.

E. Stage and commit the change (if you used git apply)
git add path/to/changed-file.css
git commit -m "Apply CSS fix from teammate (fix-style.patch)"


If you want the patch author's metadata preserved (author name and email) but used git apply, you can set the author on commit:

git commit --author="Their Name <their.email@example.com>" -m "Apply CSS fix from teammate"

F. If you used git am it already created a commit

Check commit with:

git log -1


It will show the latest commit (author and message from the patch).

G. Push the commit to remote (so it's in project history on GitHub)
git push origin your-branch-name

3) Verify it‚Äôs now part of history
git log --oneline
# or for more detail:
git log -1  # shows last commit author, date, message


If you see the commit, the patch is in Git history.

B. Docker ‚Äî containerization basics & answers to the 10 Docker questions (child-level detail)

I‚Äôll first give a quick Dockerfile example for your Maven/Tomcat webapp, then answer each numbered question with commands and simple explanations.

Dockerfile (multi-stage build ‚Äî build with Maven, run with Tomcat)

Create a file named Dockerfile in your project root:

# 1) Build stage: use Maven to build the WAR
FROM maven:3.8.6-jdk-11 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
# build the project and skip tests for faster iteration; remove -DskipTests to run tests
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 2) Run stage: use official Tomcat to run the WAR
FROM tomcat:9.0
# Replace the path below with your actual WAR name in target/
COPY --from=build /app/target/FoodSystem-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/FoodSystem.war

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]


What happens

Stage 1 (build): Maven runs and produces target/*.war.

Stage 2 (run): Tomcat image runs and we copy the WAR into Tomcat‚Äôs webapps folder.

EXPOSE 8080 documents the port; docker run -p maps it to host.

If your WAR name is different, update the COPY --from=build ... source path.

Now the 10 Docker questions ‚Äî exact commands + simple explanations
1) Pull the official nginx:latest image from Docker Hub
docker pull nginx:latest


What it does: downloads the nginx image to your machine so you can run containers from it.

2) Run the pulled nginx image as container named mynginx, exposing host port 8090
docker run -d --name mynginx -p 8090:80 nginx:latest


-d runs in background (detached).

--name mynginx gives the container a friendly name.

-p 8090:80 maps host port 8090 to the container‚Äôs port 80 (nginx default).

After this, open http://localhost:8090 in browser ‚Äî you should see nginx welcome page.

3) How to check which host port is mapped to container port 8080

Method A ‚Äî list running containers

docker ps


Look at the PORTS column, e.g. 0.0.0.0:8090->80/tcp shows host:container mapping.

Method B ‚Äî show mapping for a specific container

docker port mycontainer 8080
# example:
docker port mywebapp 8080


This prints something like 0.0.0.0:9090 meaning container port 8080 is reachable at host 9090.

4) Stop a running container named myapp
docker stop myapp


What it does: sends a graceful stop signal; container shuts down.

If it does not stop in time, force kill:

docker kill myapp

5) Run your web app container and expose internal port 5000 on host port 8080
docker run -d --name webapp -p 8080:5000 your-image-name:tag


This maps host 8080 ‚Üí container 5000.

Replace your-image-name:tag with the image built from your Dockerfile.

6) Pull official python image, run it in a container, and list running containers
docker pull python:latest
# run interactive container (example: sleep forever so it stays running)
docker run -d --name mypython python:latest sleep infinity

# list running containers
docker ps


sleep infinity keeps the container alive so you can docker exec into it; replace with -it python:latest /bin/bash if you want interactive shell.

7) Verify whether web app is accessible on port 8080 and solve conflicts

Check accessibility

From terminal:

curl -I http://localhost:8080/


-I shows HTTP headers; a 200 OK means reachable.

From browser: open http://localhost:8080.

If you get a port conflict (port already used):

Find the process using port 8080:

Linux/macOS:

sudo lsof -i :8080
# or
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 8080


Windows (PowerShell):

netstat -ano | findstr :8080


Stop the conflicting service (for example Tomcat or another Docker container):

# If it's a Docker container named otherapp:
docker stop otherapp
# If it's a system service (Linux example)
sudo systemctl stop tomcat


Or use a different host port when running your container:

docker run -d -p 9090:5000 your-image-name
# now open http://localhost:9090

8) If the application does not run properly on port 8080, update config, rebuild, and run on 9090

Common steps

Edit app config or Dockerfile as needed (for example, your app may listen on a different internal port; ensure the Dockerfile/cmd matches).

Rebuild image:

docker build -t my-web-app:latest .


Run on host port 9090:

docker run -d --name myweb -p 9090:8080 my-web-app:latest


Check logs for errors:

docker logs -f myweb


Use -f (follow) to stream logs.

9) How to stop a running container and then start it
docker stop myweb   # stop, graceful
docker start myweb  # start an existing stopped container


To restart immediately:

docker restart myweb


Note: docker run creates a new container; docker start restarts an existing stopped container.

10) How to check container status

List running containers:

docker ps


List all containers (running and stopped):

docker ps -a


See resource usage (CPU / memory) for running containers:

docker stats


Get detailed info about a container:

docker inspect myweb

C. Docker Compose ‚Äî run FoodOrderingSystem + PostgreSQL (10 marks) ‚Äî step-by-step like a child

We will create docker-compose.yml to run two containers: foodsystem (your app) and db (Postgres). I‚Äôll show the compose file, the init SQL to pre-load data, how to run it, and how to verify the DB data.

1) docker-compose.yml (full example)

Create a file docker-compose.yml in project root:

version: "3.8"

services:

Explain like a child

foodsystem is your web app. It uses the image from Docker Hub your-dockerhub-username/foodsystem:latest. If you don‚Äôt want to pull from Docker Hub you can uncomment build: . to build the image from the local Dockerfile.

ports: "7078:8080" maps host port 7078 to container 8080 ‚Äî open http://localhost:7078 to see your app.

db runs PostgreSQL and uses ./db-init to run SQL files automatically only the first time the DB container creates the database.

2) How to add initial SQL to insert data (so the DB has example rows)

Create a folder db-init next to docker-compose.yml. Inside it create a file 01-init-data.sql with sample SQL:

-- db-init/01-init-data.sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    item VARCHAR(100),
    price INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO orders (item, price) VALUES
('Veg Thali', 120),
('Tea', 15),
('Pizza Slice', 80);


Important: Files in ./db-init are executed once when the Postgres data directory is initialized. If you already ran the db service and it has persisted data, the init scripts will not run again unless you remove the volume.

3) Steps to run the whole stack
A. If your app image is on Docker Hub
# in directory with docker-compose.yml
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d


Docker Compose will pull your-dockerhub-username/foodsystem:latest and postgres:14 then start both containers.

B. If you want to build locally instead of pulling

Edit docker-compose.yml and replace the image: line for foodsystem with:

  foodsystem:
    build: .
    image: foodsystem-local:latest


Then run:

docker-compose up -d --build

4) Verify the app and DB
Check containers are running
docker-compose ps

Check your app

Open in browser: http://localhost:7078
Or test with curl:

curl -I http://localhost:7078

Connect to PostgreSQL and check inserted data
# find db container name
docker-compose ps
# assume it is named projectname_db_1. To connect:
docker exec -it <db-container-name> psql -U foodadmin -d fooddb

# inside psql prompt:
SELECT * FROM orders;


You should see the rows inserted from 01-init-data.sql.

If init script didn't run: likely because the DB volume already exists (Postgres only runs init scripts on a fresh data directory). To force re-run, stop containers and remove the DB volume:

docker-compose down
docker volume rm <project>_db-data    # careful: this deletes DB data
docker-compose up -d

Extra helpful bits (child-friendly reminders)

How to push your app image to Docker Hub (so docker-compose pulls it):

Build image locally:

docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/foodsystem:latest .


Login:

docker login


(Enter Docker Hub username & password)

Push:

docker push your-dockerhub-username/foodsystem:latest


If your app needs environment variables to connect to DB, set them in docker-compose.yml (I showed SPRING_DATASOURCE_* as an example for Spring apps).

To stop everything:

docker-compose down


Add -v to also remove volumes (data): docker-compose down -v

Quick checklists you can copy-paste
Apply patch and commit (fast)
# apply
git apply fix-style.patch

# inspect changes
git status
git diff

# commit
git add .
git commit -m "Apply CSS fix from patch"
git push origin your-branch

Build Docker image and run locally (fast)
docker build -t foodsystem-local:latest .
docker run -d --name foodsystem -p 8080:8080 foodsystem-local:latest
docker logs -f foodsystem
# visit http://localhost:8080

Start app + postgres with docker-compose
# in folder with docker-compose.yml and db-init
docker-compose up -d --build
docker-compose ps
# visit http://localhost:7078
